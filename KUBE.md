# Kubernetes Steps

Perfect fit for Kubernetes learning:

- You have a multi-service architecture (Go backend + React frontend)
- Real-time communication via WebSockets (good for testing service discovery)
- Stateful components (file system, window state) - perfect for learning persistent volumes
- Development vs production environments to practice different configurations

Key Kubernetes concepts you could learn:

- Deployments for both backend and frontend services
- Services for inter-pod communication
- ConfigMaps/Secrets for environment-specific settings
- Persistent Volumes for the /data directory file storage
- Ingress for routing traffic to your services
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling as your desktop environment grows

Practical learning steps:

1. Create Dockerfiles for both services [x]
2. Write Kubernetes manifests (deployments, services, ingress)
3. Set up persistent storage for your file system
4. Configure service discovery between frontend/backend
5. Practice rolling updates and rollbacks
